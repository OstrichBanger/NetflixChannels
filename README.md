NetflixChannels
===============
Chrome Extension that allows you to create channels and add TV shows hosted by Netflix to those channels in order to have a more traditional TV viewing experience.

Example:
Create a channel called FX and go to the pages for shows like Archer and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  Hit the "Add to FX" button that is displayed near the "Add to List" button to add them to your FX channel.  Click on the Netflix Channels button in your browser bar and hit the play button next to FX.  The extension will play random episodes for the added shows without you having to do anything.

The extension requires access to your Google Account's storage in order to keep track of channel names as well as all of the shows and episode URLs (Netflix's API is not public at the moment...).  The extension also requires permissions for all Netflix URLs.
